### About me
I'm a student at Hive Helsinki, a coding school in Finland that is part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/). I'm currently learning the ins and outs of C as a part of my studies, as it is the main language used in Hive. On the side, I'm learning Rust, as it is the language that I'm the most excited about currently. Other languages I've worked with include Python, Java and Javascript. In the future, I would love to learn some C++ and Haskell.
