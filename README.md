## About me
**Hi there and welcome to my GitHub!** 👋🏻

**Full-stack software developer at [Tietoevry](https://www.tietoevry.com/fi/) and proud [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) alumni.** 🐝

I'm a software engineer based in Helsinki, Finland. I have professional experience in developing applications with Next.js, Node.js, Java Spring Boot, AWS and Azure.
Outside of work I like to explore and learn new technologies. I am particularily interested in Go and Kotlin as backend technologies.

Currently working on: [A Ktor Todolist application](https://github.com/crl-n/ktor-to-do-list)
