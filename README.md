### About me
I'm a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), a coding school in Finland that is part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/). I'm currently learning the ins and outs of C as a part of my studies. On the side, I'm learning C++ and Rust. Other languages I've worked with include Python, Java and Javascript. In the future, I would love to learn some Haskell and Go.
